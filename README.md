masKomodo
=========

Updating moreKomodo extension to Komodo 7

morePackage.bat
===============

You'll need to add 7-zip to your path otherwise you'll be fine to run this in a windows environment in the root folder of the project.

morePackage.sh
==============

This should run without trouble on Ubuntu or Debian Linux distrobutions.  Feel free to extend it to do more.  RUN IT IN THE ROOT OF THE PROJECT FOLDER.
